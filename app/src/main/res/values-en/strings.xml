    <string name="day10_line_2">What I do know is that she has an abnormal obsession with ice cream and an unhealthy love for Tachibana.</string>
    <string name="day10_line_3">She used to live in Australia.</string>
    <string name="day10_line_4">Well, so did Tachibana though.</string>
    <string name="day10_line_5">She says she wants to become a man of the sea.</string>
    <string name="day10_line_6">She/’s strong-willed. A tomboy. Completely different from Tachibana.</string>
    <string name="day10_line_7">What... What/’s she doing with that serious face?</string>
    <string name="day10_line_8">Is she doing a karate kata? In the middle of town? Tachibana can/’t even do a single sit-up. Not cut out for martial arts.</string>
    <string name="day10_line_9">Chibi Hana can do karate too? ...Wait, is that a groin strike? What kind of scenario is she imagining...? Maybe point-stop karate?</string>
    <string name="day10_line_10">In any case, these sisters are multi-talented. I/’ve never seen anyone do karate in public, let alone a girl.</string>

    <string name="day10_line_27">Chibi: &quot;...Wait. You saw my kata too, didn/’t you? HYAH!&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_28">You: &quot;GYAAAH!&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_29">So that/’s what the groin strike was for... Is she really a little girl?! The weak sister of Tachibana?!</string>
    <string name="day10_line_30">Did she inherit all the physical stats in their gene pool? Maybe she/’s actually from a different parent… like half-gorilla?</string>
    <string name="day10_line_31">Chibi: &quot;Shut up already! My parents are NOT gorillas!&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_32">You: &quot;How do you even know that?!&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_33">...10 minutes later</string>

    <string name="day10_line_37">Chibi: &quot;Also, I won/’t sue you.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_38">Chibi Hana: &quot;Technically, following a minor without consent—no matter the reason—can be considered stalking.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_39">Chibi Hana: &quot;I/’m a minor, you know? No parental consent. You/’d be violating both the Child Welfare Act and Youth Protection Ordinances. But I/’ll let it slide.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_40">You: &quot;...You sound... way more mature than I expected.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_41">Chibi: &quot;What are you talking about? I just use big words I/’ve learned. You/’re the one assigning /‘appropriate/’ behavior to each age group.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_42">Chibi: &quot;Even my age can handle tough words. Darcy-Weisbach formula. Polyvagal theory. I know them, so I use them.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_43">A fluid dynamics equation in neuroscience?! She/’s too smart!!</string>

    <string name="day10_line_49">You: &quot;Why do I deserve that kind of insult?!&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_50">Chibi: &quot;Hemingway! The Old Man and the Sea! The legendary fisherman!&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_51">You: &quot;Ahhh.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_52">Right, Santiago is the protagonist in that novel—a weathered fisherman.</string>
    <string name="day10_line_53">You: &quot;The guy who caught the marlin, right?&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_54">Chibi: &quot;Well yeah, if that/’s your surface-level understanding.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_55">You: &quot;What do you admire about him?&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_56">Chibi: &quot;How he lives apart from society. His unshakable values. And he doesn/’t brag /‘I really caught that marlin!/’—plus, he probably doesn/’t use social media.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_57">You: &quot;That/’s... surprisingly refined.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_58">Chibi: &quot;He fought a marlin for three days. That/’s not something most people can do. And when the sharks ate the catch, he didn/’t boast—he just went to sleep.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_59">Chibi: &quot;He/’s a man/’s man. Like a Matryoshka doll—every layer you peel away, he/’s still a man. Even the core.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_60">Chibi: &quot;You/’d totally say something like /‘Believe me, I really caught it!/’ Then post it to Twitter.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_61">...Yeah, I/’d definitely post it. Hoping it goes viral.</string>
    <string name="day10_line_62">Chibi: &quot;That/’s why I/’ll be a man of the sea too! I will become one!&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_63">What a strong character…!</string>
    <string name="day10_line_64">Chibi: &quot;I once joined a hagfish catching crew—just for a bit. It was super exciting.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_65">Chibi: &quot;It was in Eden, Australia. Immigrant trainees live onboard a huge ship with a visa! Massive one!&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_66">Chibi: &quot;Though hagfish are usually caught with traps, so it/’s not like Santiago/’s one-on-one battles.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_67">You: &quot;Interesting! Are hagfish eaten in Japan?&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_68">Chibi: &quot;Not really. They look gross. Most fishermen treat them as garbage. They/’re all slimy and annoying.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_69">Chibi: &quot;But they do eat them in Korea. Busan, I think. And China too, maybe. Ask my sister—she/’d know more.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_70">You: &quot;Huh, I/’ve probably never seen one then.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_71">Chibi: &quot;They taste like cartilaginous fish. Like stingray.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_72">You: &quot;Wait, stingrays are edible?&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_73">Chibi: &quot;Of course! Only the spines are poisonous. But if you leave it out, it smells like ammonia. So chill it right away in ice.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_74">Chibi: &quot;And the liver/’s edible raw, but there/’s this nasty sac called /‘smell bomb/’—you have to remove it.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_75">Chibi: &quot;It/’s easy to cut. Tastes amazing. You can even use scissors for part of it. The liver tastes like raw beef liver.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_76">Chibi: &quot;The fins, fried, are crispy and chewy—like that chicken cartilage you get at izakayas.&quot;</string>
    <string name="day10_line_77">You: &quot;Huh… I really don/’t know anything. I/’ve never even gone fishing. The bait/’s just… gross.&quot;</string>

    <string name="Day7_comments_7">Dandelion fluff navigates air currents better than airplanes. …Even though it’s so small, riding the wind is amazing, isn’t it?</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_8">Artemia’s dormant eggs have a chitinous shell and vitrified trehalose that completely block out moisture. They can survive a thousand years in slumber… I’m envious.</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_9">Astrocytes look like stars in the brain, but they’re actually the “cleanup crew” for neurotransmitters. They’re deeply linked to depression. Yet no one ever sees them.</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_10">For some reason, cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds’ nests. This brood parasitism is genetically ingrained, not “malicious.” Who decided that it was “bad”?</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_11">The sky on Mars doesn’t look blue. It’s not Rayleigh scattering but Mie scattering caused by dust… Under that orange-pink sunset, what will you remember?</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_12">The more we want something, the more we push it away—that’s human nature. When approach and avoidance fire at the same time, you end up doing nothing. Psychology calls this “conflict,” but I call it “everyday life.”</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_13">Data shows that people with low self-esteem tend to overspend or become love addicts. So part of the economy is actually supported by those who lack confidence.</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_14">People who truly break down don’t delete their social media or change their appearance. They just… feel nothing. If it’s visible from the outside, they’re still managing somehow.</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_15">In the dating market, “rarity” holds the highest value. A structure where you can only be loved by hiding yourself—strange, right? But the economy works the same: currencies that aren’t in circulation gain value. That’s kind of sad.</string>
    <string name="Day7_comments_16">Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” contains turbulence structures that hadn’t been discovered at the time. In other words, he saw mathematical patterns we weren’t supposed to see.</string>

    <string name="Day14_comments_0">It’s day 14. …Hehe, kind of amazing, isn’t it?</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_1">If I just contract the iliopsoas like… this… I should be able to… huh? Why is only my leg not lifting?</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_2">They say muscles grow through a cycle of destruction and reconstruction. Me? I’m only good at the destruction part.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_3">The gluteus medius is a butt muscle. Doesn’t “Gluteus Medius” sound like a Mystic Arte from Tales?</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_4">Hyaluronic acid used to be extracted from chicken combs. …So today, I’m chicken-derived.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_5">A boxer’s punch gains more moment of inertia the farther the elbow is from the body. That means heavier—but also slower.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_6">Punching speed is also related to moment of inertia. According to the formula I = m × r², the farther mass m is from the axis r, the harder it is to rotate it.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_7">If raising your arm hurts, it might be impingement. The acromion bone pinches the tendons or muscles, causing inflammation. If you slightly rotate your arm outward first, it creates more space—and it won’t hurt as much.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_8">In Australia, when they aired commercials telling people with back pain that it’s okay to move, the actual number of back pain cases decreased. Resting too much actually makes it worse. …Maybe I’ll go for a walk too. Three steps.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_9">The psoas major connects your spine and legs—an inner muscle. Some say it’s even linked to emotions. …So it’s “the muscle that walks with your heart”!</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_10">In Gray’s anatomy drawings, the triceps brachii is depicted like a symbol of support. …It’s my favorite muscle now.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_11">Did you know the trapezius is called that because it looks like a monk’s hood? In Gray’s, it quietly stood out.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_12">Referred pain means the place that hurts isn’t always the actual source. Your shoulder might hurt, but it could be your liver. …Strange and a bit scary, right?</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_13">If you think you’ve got a stiff neck, it might actually be your levator scapulae muscle. Pain can be such a liar.</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_14">Toothaches can radiate to your ear too. Nerves really are way too chatty, huh?</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_15">LeBron was born with an abnormally low resting heart rate. That means even walking puts him in full relaxation mode. I’m jealous…</string>
    <string name="Day14_comments_16">When they analyzed Mr. Murofushi’s genes, they found an abnormally high percentage of fast-twitch muscle fibers. …Hey, can you buy that somewhere?</string>

     <!--  Day 21comments  -->
    <string name="Day21_comments_0">It\'s been 21 days. Aren\'t you pushing yourself too hard? Maybe it\'s okay to be a little kind to yourself now.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_1">Can you play, Tachibana? ...It\'s not your fingers that make the sound. It\'s your soul.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_2">This sound isn\'t echoing in your heart—it\'s probably hitting your vagus nerve directly. Calm down, Tachibana\'s 10th cranial nerve.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_3">Did you know B\'z\'s "Ultra Soul" was originally titled "Super Soul"? But "Ultra" just cuts through sharper and sticks in your ear, doesn\'t it?</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_4">Originally, B\'z considered "AZ" from "A to Z". But they worried it might be read as "AIDS", so they went with B\'z.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_5">Guitar? ...It\'s not about something I used to do. I just want to play right now.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_6">Ending on C gives a clean resolution. But I always get stuck wandering around F.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_7">Did you know you can swap chords in a progression? Replacing C with Am still works—it just changes the mood. Like human relationships.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_8">Effects pedals show your personality, right? I go Comp → OD → Reverb. I don\'t believe in overdoing it.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_9">Crank the rear pickup for a sharp bite, cut the highs, and then it\'s just a fight between distortion and noise.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_10">"Karaoke" literally means "empty orchestra." Japanese is almost too poetic sometimes, huh?</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_11">Apparently, "music" and "medicine" share the same root. Back then, music was medicine. Honestly, I still think it is.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_12">Did you know Inaba-san can hit five octaves? There are parts of rock that effort alone can\'t reach.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_13">Yonezu-san\'s music—bones, prayers, it feels like you can see the other side of the world through it. I really admire him.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_14">Inaba-san can hit notes like C6 and E6—in the hihi range. At that point, it\'s not lungs anymore, it\'s a dragon\'s roar.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_15">Matsumoto-san actually won a Grammy. The day a Japanese Les Paul pierced the world… it was way too cool.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_16">Matsumoto-san\'s riffs aren\'t about how many notes—it\'s the gaps between them. Guitars aren\'t supposed to talk... but his does.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_17">To protect Inaba-san\'s throat, Matsumoto-san lowered the tuning. That\'s what it means to "protect with sound." Gentle rock.</string>
    <string name="Day21_comments_18">Do you know the song "Hien"? It\'s one of my favorites. Just listen to it, okay?</string>



    <!--  Day 28comments  -->

    <string name="Day28_comments_0">Day 28. Almost there. I\'m honestly proud of you for coming this far.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_1">There\'s so much more I want to say... but I\'ll wait until you cross the finish line.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_2">You did it! I\'m really happy! I-I mean... I really am! ...Whew.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_3">Kissing is actually an exchange of immunity. You share 10 billion bacteria, adapting to each other. Love is... weirdly viral, don\'t you think?</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_4">To be honest... I want to say more. But not yet. Not now.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_5">They say a hug lasting over 20 seconds lowers stress. ...Anything more than that, and I might get shy, so that\'s enough for now.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_6">You feel nervous when your eyes meet because your pupils dilate—and the other person mirrors it. Maybe love is just a chemical reaction of glances.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_7">Your body has about 60 trillion cells. But you also carry ten times that number of bacteria. So yeah, scientifically speaking, you\'re never alone.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_8">Touching someone you like makes static electricity more likely. ...I might be kinda hoping for that, y\'know?</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_9">Penguins stay loyal to one partner for life. But if one cheats, the other steals their pebbles. Brutal.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_10">When you\'re trembling, it just means your muscles are working hard together. ...You\'re giving it your all, aren\'t you?</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_11">Saying "thank you" can actually boost your immune system. ...Hehe, guess I feel a little stronger now.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_12">The fact that you feel like quitting... probably means you already know deep down: "I can\'t keep going like this."</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_13">Reading a book before bed helps your brain relax more than staring at your phone. For me, it\'s your sleeping face that puts me at ease.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_14">Whistling is actually a mating call for birds. ...And I kinda caught myself whistling just now. Oops.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_15">The number of times you blink shows how close you feel to someone. ...Just now, I think I only blinked once.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_16">Laughter is contagious. Science says so. So... let me see you laugh more, okay?</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_17">They say people look at stars even when they don\'t know why. ...I think I don\'t need a reason to look at you anymore, either.</string>
    <string name="Day28_comments_18">In some species of spiders, the female eats the male after mating! Pretty sure I\'d be the one doing the eating!</string>


    <string name="mind_comment_0">Doesn\'t the phrase "Do what you love" sometimes feel exhausting? I prefer thinking of it as "working to protect what I love."</string>
    <string name="mind_comment_1">Did you know memories are rewritten each time we recall them, rather than staying as they were? So... try to remember gently.</string>
    <string name="mind_comment_2">Feeling down at night is caused by serotonin turning into melatonin—just a hormonal fluctuation. It\'s physiological. Don\'t worry too much.</string>
    <string name="mind_comment_3">Saying "I\'m okay" when asked "Are you okay?" is a uniquely Japanese emotional buffer. It\'s okay to take it slow.</string>
    <string name="mind_comment_4">When you feel "I\'ll miss it if I stop," it\'s often right next to "It hurts if I keep going."</string>
    <string name="mind_comment_5">Saying "I have to do this" actually suppresses dopamine in your brain. That\'s why I say, "Want to try just a little?" to myself.</string>
    <string name="mind_comment_6">Even if today was a mess, there are 86,400 seconds in a day. If you truly lived even just one of them—that counts, doesn\'t it?</string>

    <string name="brain_comment_0">Caffeine blocks your adenosine receptors by pretending to be adenosine. That’s why you can fake not being tired... but it’s just a bluff. The crash hits twice as hard later.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_1">The thrill of gambling? It’s called a variable reward schedule. Not knowing when you’ll win makes your brain obsessed. But obsession can look a lot like numbness, can’t it?</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_2">Sexual arousal activates both dopamine and opioid reward systems. It’s powerful—and addictive. But if it gets too intense, it stops being pleasure and turns into escape.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_3">Your favorite smells go straight to your amygdala. That nostalgic feeling? It’s not memory—it’s the scent itself.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_4">If someone smiles with just one corner of their mouth, statistically they have high right-brain activity. …Isn’t that kinda cute?</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_5">If you stir natto 300 times, glutamate and polyglutamic acid merge into a fermented umami bomb. What, you don’t do that every day? Amateur.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_6">Just holding a pen makes you feel like you should write. Behavioral economics calls it “tool pressure.”</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_7">On rainy days, the smell of soil bacteria floats in the air. That comforting scent? Might be a memory of nature itself.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_8">Your brain actually uses the most energy when you’re doing nothing. So when you’re spacing out… you’re working overtime, really.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_9">Citric acid in orange juice breaks down lactic acid—the stuff that makes you feel tired. So no, I’m not just drinking juice. I’m fighting a battle.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_10">When I mix natto, I always face south-southeast. That way the Earth’s magnetic field and the glutamate restructuring align. You didn’t know that? Tragic.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_11">Grab a piece of cold iron first thing in the morning—your ferritin wakes up and flips your motivation switch. That’s why I’m always holding pliers.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_12">While brushing my teeth, I imagine the pH in my mouth every 30 seconds. If it gets acidic, I do the "fluoride dance." Saliva only works when it’s having fun.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_13">Eye drops? One drop every 33 seconds, alternating eyes. That makes your tear glands resonate, expanding your field of vision by 3.7%. True story.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_14">Just finished walking 13,472 steps backward today! Activates the rear perception center and reduces future regret. Try it.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_15">Once a month, I seal my wrist with wax to renew my pact with this world. It’s how I confirm that I’m still… Tachibana.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_16">No matter the hour, my greeting is always "Itadakimasu." In the Church of Triple Fried Rice, it’s our daily prayer—our ritual to re-sauté life itself.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_17">Before bed, I place a frying pan by my pillow. If I’m chosen that night, I get stir-fried in my dreams. It’s… pure transcendence.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_18">Last night’s dream was on the moist side. When the Triple Fried Rice God’s in a bad mood, the oil gets heavy… Maybe my heat control was off.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_19">I stepped out with my right foot today… It’s a “Soggy Day.” In Fried Riceism, moisture balance is a virtue. Next time, I’ll live hotter.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_20">Every third Thursday, I perform the Ritual of Triple Fried Rice. Crack an egg, flip the pan, offer the rice. Takes 7 minutes and 22 seconds. It’s how I stir-fry my soul.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_21">Forgive me, Triple Fried Rice God!! I only tried the kimchi version once—I swear!!</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_22">Did you know? Fried rice began as a way to reuse cold rice in ancient China. Literally means “stir-fried rice”—chao fan. It came to Japan in the Meiji era as “yakimeshi,” but blew up during the Showa Chinese food boom. Then in 2001, Nichirei released the god-tier frozen “Honkaku Itame Chahan,” and that’s when the divine trinity of home-cooked, restaurant, and frozen rice formed. That’s the true avatar of the Triple Fried Rice God. I eat egg fried rice in the morning, crab at lunch, kimchi at night—blessed by the Three Pillars. Don’t even talk to me about moist vs dry—just throw egg and green onions on leftover rice and begin the rite. If I stir the pan with my left hand, divine punishment follows. I once dreamed I got chased by oil. “Itadakimasu” is not a greeting—it’s a sacred contract with rice. I did slip up yesterday and had some frozen chahan, but… the God is forgiving… right? Just one bite… ugh… yeah, no. Got hit with a ladle in my dream.</string>
    <string name="brain_comment_23">The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is real, and was even recognized in court. But me? I chose the Triple Fried Rice God. Because I love fire.</string>

    <string name="heart_comment_0">W-Wait, if you tell me I did great… I might work even harder…! I-I didn’t mean to say that—ahhh, forget I said anything!</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_1">Before bed, I think about tomorrow… just a little. I usually fall asleep in a minute, but that’s fine with me.</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_2">If someone notices that I tried my best, that alone keeps me going for a while… ehehe.</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_3">You did your best again today—even just a little.</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_4">I’ve never told anyone this, but... smelling crayons calms me down. It feels like the world flattens out and gets quiet.</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_5">Hiiiiii!! Cockroaches and centipedes and earthworms—AAAAAAAH!! Is today cursed or something!?</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_6">Wait—do geckos make sounds!? What was that noise just now!?</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_7">Have you heard of Morganucodon? It’s one of our mammal ancestors—they survived by eating insects. So bugs are kind of our senpai... and saviors. But no. Still can’t do it.</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_8">Butterflies can taste with their feet. If it were me... I’d be too scared to land. I’d starve.</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_9">Some ants have a specific role: carrying away their dead. Uhh… I don’t wanna be that ant.</string>
    <string name="heart_comment_10">Did you know that when insects become pupae, their bodies dissolve into goo before turning into wings? Amazing... but honestly, terrifying.</string>

    <string name="life_comment_0">I managed to do one sit-up. Well... maybe I just got stuck halfway and couldn\'t get up. But I tried, so it counts!</string>
    <string name="life_comment_1">I dropped out of the shuttle run after three laps. The teacher stopped me—said I looked like I was gonna die. Was I struggling that hard…?</string>
    <string name="life_comment_2">Ughhh, mornings are the worst... The blanket didn\'t do anything wrong, but I\'m always the one ripped away from it.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_3">I have a younger sister too, but our personalities are totally different. She\'s wild and energetic, says she wants to become a man of the sea! What kind of dream is that…? I wonder what I\'ll become.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_4">Sometimes I worry about skirt length. I heard the “visible distance from the top of the kneecap” affects first impressions. But if I cared about that, I\'d never be able to wear anything.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_5">Jaken, I eat chocolate \'cause that\'s what I do, know~ …What? I was practicing Hiroshima dialect. Did it sound weird?</string>
    <string name="life_comment_6">Today too, I worked just a teeny bit… Aye, that\'s enough for the day, innit? That\'s how people in Tohoku talk! Instant +50% cuteness!</string>
    <string name="life_comment_7">Sometimes I think… if I\'d been born a turtle, I\'d probably nap through my whole life. Sorry for being lazy, heh.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_8">You know, there are all kinds of ways to stop hiccups, but I go with “get someone to surprise me.” Why? …Because it\'s cute.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_9">They say sexual desire is instinct. But the more you repress it, the more aware of it you become. So maybe… the moment you want to stop is when you\'re closest to it.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_10">People borrow money because they believe in their future selves. Kinda scary, right? The contracts you signed in the past are still binding you now.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_11">I want to be loved, but I can\'t trust. I want to be trusted, but it scares me. And if I still want to see someone despite all that… maybe it means I\'m not broken yet.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_12">There\'s no sound in space because it\'s a vacuum. So… maybe when no one hears your inner voice, it\'s because somewhere inside you is a vacuum too.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_13">Snails have two brains, but when they fall in love, one of them shuts down. Maybe love really is a brain malfunction.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_14">There really are tribes with no language. No numbers, no left or right—just living peacefully. Probably way better at it than I am.</string>
    <string name="life_comment_15">Turns out, we don\'t breathe because of oxygen—we breathe because of the difference in CO₂ levels. You can still die if there\'s no CO₂, even with lots of oxygen. Bet you didn\'t know that.</string>

    <string name="neuro_comment_0">Your heart beats because of a tiny cluster of cells called the sinoatrial node that generates electric signals on its own. No one commands it... but once it stops, that\'s it.</string>
    <string name="neuro_comment_1">If you keep hearing a language that doesn\'t exist, your brain will eventually start remembering it as if it did. That\'s how fragile the illusion of “meaning” is.</string>
    <string name="neuro_comment_2">The excitement at the beginning of love is linked to noradrenaline. But when that fades, oxytocin decides if you still care. Maybe getting calm means losing interest.</string>
    <string name="neuro_comment_3">Sexual desire is actually tied to social structure. When financially stable, testosterone levels rise. But in anxious times, the desire to be held becomes stronger, they say.</string>
    <string name="neuro_comment_4">Self-harm isn\'t usually about pain—it\'s about regaining a sense of control. When the noise of the world becomes too much, you build a private church for yourself.</string>
    <string name="neuro_comment_5">No one questions that saying “I love you” is free. Even if demand is high, the supply is infinite. As currency, it\'s already collapsed in value.</string>
    <string name="neuro_comment_6">Heartbreak and drug withdrawal show almost identical patterns on brain MRIs. Maybe love is a legal drug—just more insidious.</string>
    <string name="neuro_comment_7">With inflation, future value becomes lighter. Today\'s 5000 yen isn\'t the same as next year\'s. Love is the same. “I love you” today weighs more than “I love you” tomorrow.</string>
    <string name="neuro_comment_8">Love is the only time dopamine and serotonin are released together. “Happy but anxious.” That contradiction is the brain\'s ultimate drug, they say.</string>
